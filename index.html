 <h2> Our Farm To Table Process </h2>
 <p>All of our ingredients are locally and organically sourced, and we restock everything fresh every Wednesday.
 We donâ€™t use outside companies to process our food. Everything is prepared from scratch right here in our kitchen.
 Fresh produce is carefully washed, chopped, and prepped by hand, and we make all of our plant-based dishes using whole, natural ingredients.
 Our food is stored in airtight containers in clean, sanitized areas, which we check and clean every day to keep everything fresh and safe.
 Any leftover food is donated to local shelters daily. This allows our food not to go to waste while also helping our community!
